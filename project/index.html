      </div>
      <div class="px-4 py-5 sm:p-6">
        <p>NOVA classifies foods according to the extent and purpose of industrial processing. Ultra-processed foods undergo fractionation of whole foods (typically mono-sourced from corn, wheat, soya and cane, and remnants of intensive live-stock farming) into subtances such as fructose, lactose, modified oils, hydrolysed proteins, soya protein isolate, gluten and whey protein. These substances are subsequently submitted to a series of industrial processing techniques such as hydrolysis and hydrogenation, followed by reassembly using extrusion and moulding, and lastly addition of colours, flavour enhancers and emulsifiers. These industrial processes result in hyper-palatable products with high calorific and low nutritional value, and combined with sophisticated packaging to attract and obfuscate consumers, are contributing to an obesity epidemic and associated morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>

        <p>Regular moderate intensity exercise decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and stroke. The biology of exercise is complex and involves adaptive responses in multiple organ systems. Specifically, regualr exrecise maintains local homeostatsis, protects the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, promotes repair and regeneration of tissues, enhances circadian rhythms, and supports anti-inflammatory regulation.</p>

          Behavioural approaches to nutrition and eating patterns for managing type 2 diabetes:
          <ul>
            <li>Personalised counselling strategies and medical nutrition therapy</li>
            <li>Respectful of cultural, social, economic and environmental factors</li>
            <li>Motivational interviewing</li>
            <li>Mindful eating and intuitive eating</li>
            <li>Empowerment, self-efficacy and collaborative decison making</li>
            <li>A balanced eating pattern inclusive of meals and snacks, emphasizing fiber-rich plant foods (legumes, nuts, seeds, herbs), a diversity of non-starchy vegetables, nutrient-dense carbohydrate foods (whole grains), fish, and unsaturated vegetable oils.</li>
